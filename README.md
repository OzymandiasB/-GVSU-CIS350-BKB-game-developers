# BKB Game Developers
We wanted to add our own original twist on top of a classic timeless game, Tetris. The goal is to add more shapes,a personal choice of different music, specific powerups, and more. We want the game to feel like a modern spin that would be produced from a company that already rehashes out old classics, perhaps like nintendo recreating mario.
