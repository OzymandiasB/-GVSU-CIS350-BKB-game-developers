# Introduction

    We wanted to add our own original twist on top of a classic timeless game,   Tetris. The goal is to add more shapes,a personal choice of different music, specific powerups, and more. We want the game to feel like a modern spin that would be produced from a company that already rehashes out old classics, perhaps like nintendo recreating mario.
    Using different choices of upbeat music depending on the level or powerup would add an interesting twist to the game. The goal is to make
it as immersive as possible. Another plan for this immersion would be
background changes as the blocks speed up. Small concepts like these hopefully add up to make our rendition even more addicting than the original.

# Anticipated Technologies

* Github
* Pycharm

# Method/Approach
    The plan of attack is rather simple, we will be using divide and conquer to take care of the large portions on this project. Since we will be making a tetris type game, we must first make tetris. By making a UML, we can dish out who does the board, the pieces, the game mechanics, etc.. Once we get this base level down, we can start adding our own key features. We can have two people figuring out the math/specifics of how these will work and a third will test them. By doing this
    over and over, we hope to achieve a working and fun game by the end.
# Estimated Timeline
* Creating Base level Tetris (should take 3 weeks)
* Creating Adding various media / background images to game (should take 1 week)
* Adding Items and other miscellanious things (2 weeks)
# Anticipated Problems
    The biggest problem coming to mind at the moment is the way we will make the song switches and background image switches seem natural and unintrusive. The goal is to make the game as immersive as possible and thats hard to do if they songs change in a weird static way, or the background image changes dont feel natural. The VR game Tetris Effect does a really good job at this, and its primarily what we'll strive to emulate. I think the best way to solve these issues, will just be
    to trial and error. Just getting a feel for feels the most natural for us would help us make the game feel more natural over all.
